 * In some cases, classes does not have empty constructors or constructors that can be called with null parameters. So when NeoDatis cannot create empty instances by Reflection,
 * the user can help NeoDatis registering a full instantiation helper. This Full instantiation Helper will receive the data of the object in a NonNativeObjectInfo (which is a meta representation of an java insatnce that contain all data)
 * The user then needs to get the data from the nnoi (NonNativeObjectInfo) and build the instance to return to NeoDatis
